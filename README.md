#### By _Ashley J. Ancheta_

## Description
_This application will allow the user to input a number. Based on the values from 0 to the number that they will input, there will be elements that will replace some of the values due to various conditions. Concepts such as arrays and loops from Week 3 of introduction to programming were applied to build this program._

## Specs

| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Recognize that the user input is a number | a | NaN |
| Program will return a range of numbers from 0 to the input number | 3 | 0, 1, 2, 3 |
| Given that an input contains a 1, replace with "Beep!" | 3 | 0, "Beep!", 2, 3 |
| Given that an input contains a 2, replace with "Boop!" | 3 | 0, "Beep!", "Boop!", 3 |
